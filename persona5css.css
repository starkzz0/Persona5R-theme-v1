   yo what's up 👋 
   ====================================================================================================
   
   okay so you found my css!! that's actually pretty cool ngl 
   
   real quick - huge shoutout to anzuftnw fr!! their original chika.css was on github for 
   free and honestly? major respect for sharing their work. wouldn't have this without them.
   
   anyway so this version? yeah i modified it. spent way too much time on this tbh lol
   fixed stuff, added things, made it persona 5 themed - basically made it mine. original 
   was free to use but like... maybe ask me about this one? would be nice yk
   
   what i'm asking:
   ⚠️  pls don't just yoink this and paste it in your profile without asking first
   
   ik it sounds extra but like... i worked on this?? and i'd like to know where it goes?
   not trying to be controlling or anything - just wanna know what's up. plus i might be 
   able to help you out if you need changes!
   
   what you CAN do:
   ✅ study the code all you want - go for it!
   ✅ use it as inspo - absolutely go wild!!
   ✅ take ideas/techniques - just credit if you do
   ✅ hit me up if you wanna use it - i'm chill i promise! 😊
   
   what i'd prefer you NOT do:
   ❌ don't copy it directly without asking
   ❌ don't remove the credit lines (they exist for a reason)
   ❌ don't say you made it from scratch
   ❌ don't share it like it's free to use everywhere - just send people to ask me
   ❌ don't use css spy (voidverified's tool) to steal this code - if you're gonna take it, 
      at least have the decency to ask first instead of using sneaky tools
   
   btw if you're here via css spy or similar tools:
   yeah i know about those tools. if you're using css spy to grab this code without asking,
   that's kinda messed up ngl. this isn't free for the taking just because a tool makes it
   easy to copy. have some respect for the work that went into this and just... ask? it's
   not that hard. tools like css spy make it way too easy to steal work without thinking
   about the person behind it, but you can still choose to do the right thing.
   
   wanna use it?
   just dm me on discord (starkzz_) or message me on anilist! let me know who you are and 
   what you're planning to do with it. super down to chat about it tbh
   
   also like... i'm not trying to be difficult okay?? i just put effort into this and want
   to know where it's going. plus if you ask, i can help customize it or fix stuff for you!
   
   learning/studying stuff:
   wanna study it? learn from it? get inspired? all good with me!! just maybe mention if 
   you use something specific. we're all learning here yk
   
   also pls credit both me (starkz) and anzu if you do end up using it. they deserve it too!
   
   thanks for reading all this and being cool about it <3
   questions? just ask - i don't bite! :)

   p.s. - if you're wondering why i care so much? this is my first big css project and i'm 
   weirdly attached to it lol hope that makes sense!
   
   p.p.s. - but fr if you use it and run into issues, hmu!! community is about helping each 
   other out and i'm always down to help <3

   FULL SCREEN BACKGROUND
   ==================================================================================================== */
/* 
   HOW TO CUSTOMIZE BACKGROUND:
   1. Change the image URL on line 198 to your own image URL
      - Upload to imgur, catbox.moe, or your own hosting
      - Replace the URL between the quotes
   
   2. Adjust blur amount:
      - 0px = no blur (sharp image)
      - 3px = light blur (default)
      - 5px+ = heavy blur (very soft)
   
   3. Change background-size if needed:
      - "cover" = fills entire screen (may crop)
      - "contain" = shows entire image (may leave gaps)
      - "100% 100%" = stretches to fill
   
   4. Adjust background-position:
      - "center" = centered (default)
      - "top left", "bottom right", etc.
   
   5. To remove background image entirely:
      - Remove or comment out the "background-image" line
      - Only the solid color will show
